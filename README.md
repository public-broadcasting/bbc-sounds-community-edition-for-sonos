# BBC Sounds (Community Edition) for Sonos

In December 2021 <a href="https://support.sonos.com/services/bbc-sounds">BBC Sounds</a> launched in the <a href="https://www.sonos.com/controller-app">Sonos app</a>. Listeners with Sonos speakers in the UK are able to enjoy BBC radio, music mixes and podcasts, using the Sonos app.

Listerners outside the UK have to fall back on the <a href="https://support.sonos.com/services/radio-by-tunein">TuneIn</a>  integration or <a href="https://www.sonos.com/sonos-radio">Sonos Radio</a>, which relys on TuneIn. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/questions/recent-changes-to-bbc-sounds/shoutcast-closure">BBC streams</a> available on TuneIn occasionally <a herf="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/questions/recent-changes-to-bbc-sounds/shoutcast-closure">play an announcement indicating that</a> the streams are outdated and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/help/questions/recent-changes-to-bbc-sounds/shoutcast-closure">will stop working in mid-2023</a>. There is no way to have the streams updated to get rid of the message.

Besides the alternative of downloading the BBC sounds app for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/bbc-sounds/id1380676511">iOS</a>/<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbc.sounds">Android</a> and transferring it to Sonos via <a href="https://support.sonos.com/article/stream-airplay-audio-to-sonos">AirPlay</a>, <a href="https://support.sonos.com/article/use-bluetooth-on-sonos">Bluetooth</a> or <a href="https://support.sonos.com/article/use-line-in-on-sonos">Line-In</a> (based on the specs of the existing speakers), there are also options to <a href="https://support.sonos.com/article/add-an-internet-radio-station-to-sonos">manually add the desired radio station</a> to Sonos.

**BBC Sounds (Community Edition)** bring back the classic Sonos control in order to listen to your favorite stations, without the hassle of using third-party apps and cast technologies.
